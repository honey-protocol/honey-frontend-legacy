The Honey Finance Ecosystem consists of several components this repo represents the Front-end.

<b>***Note @Heron 
- what is the min. required node version in order to run the project?******</b>

In order to run this project you need to create a 
```bash
.env #you can use the .env.example file as silver lining
``` 
The RPC_URL which is required is the standard mainnet RPC. You should replace this with a custom one if you are in need of better performance. We currently do not have farm listed on devnet, however we will add instructions to add farm to devnet in the future.

After cloning the repo locally navigate to the root of the directory and run the following commands:

```bash
yarn install #installs all required packages
yarn dev #spins up the server at localhost:3000
```
In order to test the production server run:
```bash
yarn build
```
